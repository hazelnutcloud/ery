# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Task Thread System Implementation**: Implementing the core task thread architecture for Ery Discord moderation bot with context-aware AI processing and tool execution.

## Recent Changes

- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Created core memory bank files to establish project documentation structure
- **Project Structure Analysis**: Reviewed existing minimal project setup with basic Bun/TypeScript configuration
- **Task Thread System Design**: Updated memory bank with comprehensive task thread architecture
- **Tool System Definition**: Documented complete set of Discord API tools for task thread execution
- **Architecture Evolution**: Shifted from simple event-driven to task thread-based processing model

## Current State

### What Exists
- Basic Bun project structure with TypeScript
- Empty `src/index.ts` file (entry point)
- Basic `package.json` with minimal dependencies
- Complete memory bank documentation structure

### What's Missing
- Discord.js and related dependencies installation
- Database setup with Drizzle ORM and SQLite
- Core bot architecture implementation
- Discord bot token configuration
- Basic event handlers and command structure

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Add discord.js, drizzle-orm, and task thread related packages
2. **Environment Setup**: Create environment configuration for Discord bot token
3. **Database Schema**: Design schema including task_threads and tool_executions tables
4. **Task Thread Manager**: Implement core task thread creation and lifecycle management
5. **Context Manager**: Build message history fetching and context formatting system
6. **Tool System**: Create standardized tool execution framework with Discord API wrappers
7. **Event Handler**: Implement message event handling that triggers task thread creation
8. **AI Agent Integration**: Connect AI processing with task thread context and tool execution

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Task Thread Architecture**: One active thread per channel with parallel processing across channels
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Always provide recent message history to AI for intelligent decisions
- **Tool-Based Actions**: All Discord operations performed through standardized, auditable tools
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for task threads, tools, context management, and AI processing
- **Event-Driven**: React to Discord message events to trigger task thread creation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation for reliability across all components
- **Database First**: Design schema including task thread state and tool execution logs

### Development Preferences
- **Bun Runtime**: Leveraging Bun's performance benefits over Node.js
- **Modern TypeScript**: Using latest TypeScript features and patterns
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations over raw SQL
- **Incremental Development**: Build and test features incrementally

## Important Patterns and Insights

### Project Organization
- Memory bank serves as single source of truth for project state
- Clear separation between documentation and implementation
- Modular architecture allows independent feature development

### Technical Patterns
- Event-driven architecture for Discord interactions
- Strategy pattern for different moderation actions
- Configuration-driven behavior for server customization
- Learning system for continuous improvement

## Current Challenges

1. **Task Thread Concurrency**: Managing multiple parallel task threads without resource conflicts
2. **Context Size Management**: Balancing message history size with AI processing limits
3. **Thread Lifecycle**: Proper cleanup and state management for task thread completion
4. **Database Design**: Schema design for task thread state, tool executions, and audit logs
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for task thread failures and tool execution errors
6. **Memory Management**: Preventing memory leaks from long-running or abandoned task threads

## Learning and Project Insights

- Discord.js library handles API rate limiting automatically
- SQLite is sufficient for initial development but may need scaling consideration
- Modular architecture is crucial for maintainability
- Documentation-first approach helps maintain project clarity
- TypeScript provides significant benefits for Discord API interactions
