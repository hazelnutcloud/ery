# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**AI-Powered Discord Bot Fully Functional**: Ery is a complete AI-powered Discord moderation bot with:
- Loop-based AI agent processing with tool execution
- Context-aware message batching and processing
- Comprehensive Discord API tool integration
- Real-time moderation and communication capabilities

## Recent Changes

### Core Architecture
- **Task Thread System**: Complete implementation with message batching, parallel processing, and channel isolation
- **AI Integration**: Loop-based agent that processes context, executes tools, and generates responses
- **Tool System**: Comprehensive Discord API tools with permission checking and validation
- **Database Schema**: Full SQLite schema with Drizzle ORM and migration system

### Message Processing Improvements
- **Message Batching**: Intelligent batching with count, time, and mention triggers
- **Context Integration**: Bot messages included in conversation history with message IDs
- **Reply System**: AI can reply to specific messages by ID using enhanced SendMessageTool
- **Conversation Flow**: Complete conversation state maintained throughout AI processing loop

## Current State

### What's Working
- Complete Discord bot that connects and processes messages
- Task thread system with automatic cleanup and lifecycle management
- AI agent with OpenRouter integration and tool execution
- Database with proper migrations and type safety
- Core Discord tools: SendMessage, BanMember, FetchMessages
- Event handling and graceful shutdown

### What's Missing
- Extended tool library (kick, mute, role management, etc.)
- Server-specific configuration and rules
- Advanced moderation features and community activities
- Web dashboard for monitoring and configuration
- Production deployment setup

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Tool Library**: Add more Discord API tools for comprehensive moderation
2. **Configuration System**: Server-specific settings and rule management
3. **Testing**: Real Discord server testing with bot token and API keys
4. **Advanced Features**: Community activities, analytics, and learning systems
5. **Deployment**: Docker containerization and cloud deployment

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Patterns
- **AI-First Design**: All bot interactions go through AI agent with tool execution
- **Channel Isolation**: One active task thread per channel for controlled processing
- **Tool-Based Actions**: All Discord operations performed through standardized tools
- **Context-Rich Processing**: AI receives full message history and metadata

### Development Preferences
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage for all components
- **Incremental Testing**: Build and verify each component before expansion
- **Modular Design**: Independent tools and systems for easy testing and maintenance
- **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling at every system level

## Important Technical Insights

### Task Thread Flow
1. Message → MessageBatcher → Task Thread → AI Agent → Tool Execution → Response
2. Context includes recent message history with user and bot messages
3. AI processes in loop until no more tool calls needed
4. All communication happens through send_message tool

### Performance Considerations
- SQLite with connection pooling for efficient database operations
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- Automatic cleanup of inactive threads (5-minute timeout)
- Rate limiting handled by discord.js

### Current Limitations
- Requires Discord bot token and OpenRouter API key for operation
- Limited to basic moderation tools (ban, message sending, fetching)
- No web interface for configuration
- Single-server deployment model
