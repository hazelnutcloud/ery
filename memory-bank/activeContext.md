# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Task Thread System Implementation**: Core task thread architecture is now implemented with context-aware message fetching and thread lifecycle management. Ready for AI integration and tool system implementation.

## Recent Changes

- **Dependencies Installed**: discord.js, discord-api-types, drizzle-orm, drizzle-kit (using Bun's native SQLite)
- **Database Schema Created**: Complete schema for all tables including task threads, tools, users, servers, moderation
- **Database Connection**: Implemented with Bun SQLite, now uses drizzle-orm migrations
- **Database Migrations**: 
  - Set up drizzle-kit for generating and managing migrations
  - Created initial migration from schema (0000_tricky_ultimo.sql)
  - Added indices directly to drizzle schemas
  - Generated additional migrations for indices (0001_gorgeous_lily_hollister.sql, 0002_odd_skreet.sql)
  - Database initialization runs all migrations automatically
  - Removed legacy table creation functions
  - Created migration scripts and npm commands
  - All indices now managed through drizzle-kit migrations
- **Configuration System**: Created config with Discord, database, task thread, and AI settings
- **Core Utilities**: Logger with colored output, UUID generator, composite ID utilities
- **Discord Client**: Bot client with all required intents and partials
- **Task Thread System**:
  - Types defined for task threads and tool executions
  - Context Manager fetches recent message history (20 messages within 30 minutes)
  - Task Thread Manager handles thread lifecycle, channel isolation, and cleanup
- **Event Handlers**: Ready event (sets presence) and messageCreate (creates task threads)
- **Main Entry Point**: index.ts with graceful shutdown handling

## Current State

### What Exists
- Complete project structure with TypeScript configuration
- Database schema and connection with migration-based initialization
- Drizzle-kit integration for database migrations
- Core task thread system with context fetching
- Basic Discord bot that connects and responds to messages
- Event-driven architecture with message handling
- Logging system with configurable levels
- Environment configuration template
- Migration scripts and database management commands

### What's Missing
- Tool system implementation (Discord API wrappers)
- AI agent integration for processing task threads
- Moderation module (ban, kick, timeout, etc.)
- Community module (events, polls, engagement)
- Interaction module (conversational AI, queries)
- Actual task thread processing logic
- Tool execution framework

## Next Steps

1. **Create Tool System Base**: Implement tool types and execution framework
2. **Implement Discord Tools**: Create wrappers for all Discord API operations
3. **AI Agent Stub**: Create placeholder AI processing that can execute tools
4. **Test Basic Flow**: Verify message → thread → tool execution pipeline
5. **Moderation Tools**: Implement ban_member, kick_member, timeout_member, etc.
6. **Interaction Tools**: Implement send_message, add_reaction, create_thread, etc.
7. **Information Tools**: Implement fetch_messages, get_member_info, search_messages, etc.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Bun Native SQLite**: Using Bun's built-in SQLite instead of better-sqlite3
- **No dotenv**: Leveraging Bun's automatic .env file loading
- **Type-Safe Imports**: Using `type` imports for TypeScript types per verbatimModuleSyntax
- **Channel Type Checking**: Handling both guild channels and DMs properly
- **Memory + Database**: Hybrid approach with in-memory cache and persistent storage
- **Cleanup Interval**: 1-minute interval to clean up inactive threads (5-minute timeout)

### Development Preferences
- **Incremental Testing**: Build and test each component before moving to the next
- **Type Safety First**: Ensuring all Discord API interactions are properly typed
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling at every level
- **Modular Tools**: Each tool is independent and can be tested separately

## Important Patterns and Insights

### Task Thread Flow
1. Message received → Check thread limits
2. Create/get active thread for channel
3. Fetch context (recent messages)
4. Process with AI (TODO)
5. Execute tools based on AI decisions (TODO)
6. Complete thread with results

### Context Management
- Fetches up to 20 messages within 30-minute window
- Includes message metadata (attachments, mentions, links)
- Formats context for AI consumption
- Handles both text channels and DMs

### Thread Lifecycle
- One active thread per channel at a time
- 5-minute timeout for inactive threads
- Automatic cleanup every minute
- Thread state persisted to database

## Current Challenges

1. **AI Integration**: Need to decide on AI provider integration approach
2. **Tool Permission System**: Ensuring bot has permissions before executing tools
3. **Rate Limiting**: Discord.js handles this, but need to monitor
4. **Testing Strategy**: How to test tool execution without affecting real servers
5. **Error Recovery**: Handling partial tool execution failures

## Learning and Project Insights

- Bun's built-in SQLite is performant and reduces dependencies
- Discord.js v14 has excellent TypeScript support
- Task thread pattern provides good isolation and concurrency control
- Context window of 20 messages seems reasonable for most moderation decisions
- Need to carefully handle permissions for each Discord operation
