## System Architecture Summary

```
Discord Message → Message Batcher → Task Thread → AI Agent → Tool Execution → Response
                                                     ↓
                                               OpenRouter API
                                                     ↓
                                             Function Calls → Tools
```

The bot now has a complete AI-powered pipeline that can:
1. Receive Discord messages and batch them intelligently
2. Process context with AI to understand user intent
3. Execute appropriate Discord tools based on AI decisions
4. Generate natural language responses
5. Log everything for audit and improvement

**Ready for production testing with Discord bot token and OpenRouter API key!**

### Agent Loop-Based Refactoring (Just Completed!)
- ✅ **Loop-Based Processing**: Agent now runs in a continuous loop processing tool calls
- ✅ **Tool Result Feedback**: Tool execution results are sent back to AI as conversation context
- ✅ **Content Discarding**: AI response content is discarded - only tool calls matter
- ✅ **Forced Tool Usage**: AI must use send_message tool to communicate with users
- ✅ **Conversation State**: Maintains full conversation history with tool results
- ✅ **Safety Limits**: Max 10 iterations and 30-second timeout to prevent infinite loops
- ✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Tracks loop iterations and conversation message count
- ✅ **Updated System Prompt**: Clear instructions that AI must use tools for all communication

### AI Context & Tool Refactoring (Just Completed!)
- ✅ **Bot Message Context**: Bot messages now included in conversation history as "assistant" role
- ✅ **Enhanced Send Message Tool**: Replaced `reply` boolean with `replyToMessageId` for precise message targeting
- ✅ **Flexible Reply System**: AI can now reply to any specific message by ID instead of only trigger message
- ✅ **Chronological Context**: All messages (user and bot) properly ordered and formatted for AI
- ✅ **Build Verification**: All changes compile successfully and maintain type safety
- ✅ **Memory Bank Updated**: Documentation reflects the latest architectural improvements
