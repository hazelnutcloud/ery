# Progress

## What Works

### Project Foundation
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Basic Bun/TypeScript project initialized
- ✅ **Memory Bank**: Complete documentation structure established
- ✅ **Development Environment**: Bun runtime configured with TypeScript support
- ✅ **Dependencies**: discord.js, discord-api-types, drizzle-orm installed

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ **Environment Configuration**: Template created with Discord bot token support
- ✅ **Database Setup**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM, auto-creates tables on startup
- ✅ **Bot Client**: Discord client with proper intents and partials
- ✅ **Logging System**: Colored logger with configurable levels
- ✅ **Configuration System**: Centralized config with validation

### Task Thread System
- ✅ **Types & Interfaces**: Complete type definitions for task threads
- ✅ **Context Manager**: Fetches recent message history with metadata
- ✅ **Thread Manager**: Creates, manages, and cleans up task threads
- ✅ **Channel Isolation**: One active thread per channel enforced
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: Inactive threads cleaned up after 5 minutes

### Event Handling
- ✅ **Ready Event**: Bot presence and startup logging
- ✅ **Message Create**: Creates task threads for new messages
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on SIGINT/SIGTERM

### Database Schema
- ✅ **Users Table**: Discord user data and preferences
- ✅ **Servers Table**: Server configurations and rules
- ✅ **Task Threads Table**: Thread state and execution history
- ✅ **Tool Executions Table**: Audit log of tool usage
- ✅ **Moderation Logs**: Action history and audit trail
- ✅ **User Guild Data**: Per-server user information
- ✅ **Interactions Table**: User interaction history

## What's Left to Build

### Tool System
- ❌ **Tool Base Classes**: Abstract tool class and execution framework
- ❌ **Discord API Tools**: Wrappers for all Discord operations
- ❌ **Permission Checking**: Verify bot permissions before tool execution
- ❌ **Tool Registry**: System to register and discover available tools

### AI Integration
- ❌ **AI Agent Interface**: Abstract interface for AI providers
- ❌ **Context Processing**: Convert task thread context to AI prompts
- ❌ **Tool Selection**: AI decides which tools to execute
- ❌ **Response Generation**: AI generates appropriate responses

### Feature Modules
- ❌ **Moderation Module**: Ban, kick, mute, message deletion tools
- ❌ **Community Module**: Events, polls, engagement activities
- ❌ **Interaction Module**: Conversational AI, query handling
- ❌ **Configuration Module**: Server-specific settings management

### Advanced Features
- ❌ **Learning System**: Track interactions and improve responses
- ❌ **Analytics**: Server activity and moderation statistics
- ❌ **Web Dashboard**: Configuration and monitoring interface
- ❌ **Backup System**: Data export and recovery

### Deployment
- ❌ **Docker Configuration**: Containerization setup
- ❌ **fly.io Deployment**: Cloud deployment configuration
- ❌ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- ❌ **Monitoring**: Health checks and alerting

## Current Status

**Phase**: Core Infrastructure Complete  
**Progress**: 40% Complete  
**Focus**: Task thread system implemented, ready for tool system and AI integration

### Immediate Priorities
1. Create base tool system architecture
2. Implement core Discord API tools
3. Add placeholder AI agent for testing
4. Test end-to-end message processing flow

### Blockers
- Need Discord bot token for testing (user will provide)
- AI provider decision pending (OpenAI vs others)

## Known Issues

- No actual processing logic for task threads yet
- No tool execution implementation
- AI integration not started
- No permission checking for Discord operations

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- **Runtime Choice**: Selected Bun for performance benefits
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity and deployment ease
- **ORM**: Drizzle for type safety and modern patterns

### Recent Decisions
- **Bun Native SQLite**: Dropped better-sqlite3 dependency
- **No dotenv**: Using Bun's automatic .env loading
- **Type Imports**: Using `type` imports for TypeScript types
- **Hybrid Storage**: Memory cache + database for performance

### Architectural Evolution
- Started with simple structure, evolved to modular architecture
- Task thread system designed for concurrency and isolation
- Event-driven design for scalability
- Tool-based approach for all Discord operations

### Future Considerations
- PostgreSQL migration path for larger deployments
- Redis for distributed caching
- Kubernetes deployment for high availability
- Multi-shard support for large bot instances
