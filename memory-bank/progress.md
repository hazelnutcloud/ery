# Progress

## What Works

### Project Foundation
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Basic Bun/TypeScript project initialized
- ✅ **Memory Bank**: Complete documentation structure established
- ✅ **Development Environment**: Bun runtime configured with TypeScript support

### Documentation
- ✅ **Project Brief**: Clear project vision and technical specifications
- ✅ **Product Context**: Problem definition and user experience goals
- ✅ **Technical Context**: Technology stack and development setup
- ✅ **System Patterns**: Architecture patterns and design decisions
- ✅ **Active Context**: Current work focus and next steps

## What's Left to Build

### Core Infrastructure
- ❌ **Dependencies**: Install discord.js, drizzle-orm, and task thread related packages
- ❌ **Environment Configuration**: Set up environment variables and bot token management
- ❌ **Database Setup**: Initialize SQLite database with Drizzle ORM including task thread tables
- ❌ **Bot Client**: Create Discord bot client with basic connection

### Task Thread System
- ❌ **Task Thread Manager**: Core task thread creation, lifecycle management, and channel isolation
- ❌ **Context Manager**: Message history fetching and context formatting for AI processing
- ❌ **Tool Executor**: Standardized tool execution framework with Discord API wrappers
- ❌ **Event Handler**: Message event processing that triggers task thread creation
- ❌ **AI Agent Integration**: Connect AI processing with task thread context and tool execution

### Architecture Implementation
- ❌ **Concurrency Control**: Manage parallel task threads and prevent resource conflicts
- ❌ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for task threads and tool execution
- ❌ **State Management**: Task thread state persistence and cleanup mechanisms

### Feature Modules
- ❌ **Moderation Module**: Ban, kick, mute, message deletion
- ❌ **Community Module**: Events, polls, engagement activities
- ❌ **Learning Module**: AI-powered responses and adaptation
- ❌ **Configuration System**: Server-specific settings and rules

### Database Schema
- ❌ **Users Table**: Discord user data and preferences
- ❌ **Servers Table**: Server configurations and rules
- ❌ **Task Threads Table**: Active task thread state and execution history
- ❌ **Tool Executions Table**: Audit log of all tool usage with results
- ❌ **Moderation Logs**: Action history and audit trail
- ❌ **Learning Data**: Context and interaction history

### Deployment
- ❌ **Docker Configuration**: Containerization setup
- ❌ **fly.io Deployment**: Cloud deployment configuration
- ❌ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment

## Current Status

**Phase**: Project Initialization  
**Progress**: 15% Complete  
**Focus**: Foundation and documentation established, ready for implementation

### Immediate Priorities
1. Install and configure dependencies
2. Set up database schema and connections
3. Create basic bot client and event handling
4. Implement command system foundation

### Blockers
- None currently identified
- Need Discord bot token for testing (user will need to provide)

## Known Issues

- Empty `src/index.ts` file needs implementation
- No dependencies installed yet
- No environment configuration
- No database schema defined

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- **Runtime Choice**: Selected Bun for performance benefits
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity and deployment ease
- **ORM**: Drizzle for type safety and modern patterns

### Architectural Evolution
- Started with simple structure, planning for modular growth
- Emphasized documentation-first approach for maintainability
- Designed for scalability while keeping initial implementation simple

### Future Considerations
- Consider database migration to PostgreSQL for larger deployments
- Plan for horizontal scaling with multiple bot instances
- Evaluate AI provider integration for learning features
- Implement advanced in-memory caching strategies for scaling
