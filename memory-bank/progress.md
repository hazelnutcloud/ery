# Progress

## Current Status

**Phase**: AI Integration Complete - Fully Functional Discord Bot  
**Progress**: 75% Complete  
**Focus**: AI-powered Discord moderation bot with comprehensive tool execution

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ **Project Foundation**: Bun/TypeScript project with proper configuration
- ✅ **Database System**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM and automated migrations
- ✅ **Discord Integration**: Bot client with all required intents and event handling
- ✅ **Configuration**: Environment-based config with validation
- ✅ **Logging**: Colored logger with configurable levels

### Task Thread System
- ✅ **Message Processing**: Intelligent message batching with multiple triggers
- ✅ **Thread Management**: Channel isolation with automatic cleanup
- ✅ **Context System**: Rich message history with metadata for AI processing
- ✅ **Parallel Processing**: Multiple channels can be processed simultaneously

### AI Integration
- ✅ **OpenRouter Provider**: Complete AI integration with error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ **Agent Loop**: Loop-based processing with tool execution and conversation state
- ✅ **Tool System**: Comprehensive Discord API tools with permission validation
- ✅ **Context Processing**: AI receives formatted message history and metadata

### Available Tools
- ✅ **SendMessageTool**: Send messages with reply targeting by message ID
- ✅ **BanMemberTool**: Ban users with reason and duration options
- ✅ **FetchMessagesTool**: Retrieve message history with filtering
- ✅ **Tool Registry**: Automatic tool discovery and OpenAI function schema generation

## What's Left to Build

### Extended Tool Library
- ❌ **Moderation Tools**: Kick, mute, role management, message deletion
- ❌ **Information Tools**: Member info, server stats, audit logs
- ❌ **Utility Tools**: Channel management, invites, threads, reactions

### Advanced Features
- ❌ **Server Configuration**: Per-server rules and settings
- ❌ **Community Features**: Events, polls, engagement activities
- ❌ **Analytics**: Server activity tracking and moderation statistics
- ❌ **Learning System**: Behavior adaptation based on server feedback

### Deployment & Operations
- ❌ **Docker Configuration**: Containerization for consistent deployment
- ❌ **Cloud Deployment**: fly.io configuration and CI/CD pipeline
- ❌ **Monitoring**: Health checks, alerting, and performance tracking
- ❌ **Web Dashboard**: Configuration interface and real-time monitoring

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Live Testing**: Deploy with Discord bot token and OpenRouter API key
2. **Tool Expansion**: Add kick, mute, and role management tools
3. **Configuration Commands**: Server admin commands for bot setup
4. **Error Handling**: Improve error messaging and recovery

## Known Issues

- Requires Discord bot token and OpenRouter API key for operation
- Limited tool library (only 3 Discord tools currently)
- No server-specific configuration system
- No web interface for monitoring or configuration

## Architecture Summary

```
Discord Message → Message Batcher → Task Thread → AI Agent → Tool Execution → Response
                                                     ↓
                                               OpenRouter API
                                                     ↓
                                             Function Calls → Discord Tools
```

The bot implements a complete AI-powered pipeline that:
1. Intelligently batches Discord messages based on multiple triggers
2. Processes context with AI to understand user intent and server state
3. Executes appropriate Discord tools based on AI decisions
4. Maintains conversation state throughout the processing loop
5. Logs all actions for audit and debugging

## Next Development Phase

**Focus**: Extended tool library and server configuration system
**Goal**: Production-ready Discord moderation bot with comprehensive features
**Timeline**: Tool expansion → Configuration system → Deployment setup → Advanced features
